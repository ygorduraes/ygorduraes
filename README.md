### Hi there 👋

👨🏻‍💻 Hey there! I'm Ygor Durães, a full-stack engineer and certified Scrum Master based in Porto, Portugal.

🏗 I love creating useful things, be it a complete web app or a no-code automation. As long as it's useful, I can track the outcomes objectively and it's making other people's lives easier.

📚 My generalist way of learning has been allowing me to stack multiple skills from different areas in the past 13 years of work experience, ranging from software engineering to project management and marketing.

⏺ I follow the minimalist maker mindset, so if I can build it quickly, easily and it delivers a HUGE value, then I'm happy.
